# Console Array Project

This project is a console application that demonstrates the use of arrays in C#. It includes functionality to perform binary search and to check for pairs in an array whose sum equals a specified target value.

## Files in the Project

- **Program.cs**: The entry point of the console application where the execution begins.
- **UsingArrays.cs**: Contains the `GfG` class with methods for binary search and checking for pairs in an array.
  - `static bool binarySearch(int[] arr, int left, int right, int target)`: Performs binary search on a sorted array.
  - `static bool twoSum(int[] arr, int target)`: Checks if any two numbers in the array add up to the target value.
- **ConsoleArrayProject.csproj**: The project file containing configuration settings for the application.

## How to Run

1. Open the project in your preferred C# development environment.
2. Build the project to restore any dependencies.
3. Run the application to see the output based on the provided array and target value.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to practice and demonstrate basic array manipulation techniques in C#, including searching and pair finding algorithms.
